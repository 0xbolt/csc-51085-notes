  abstract = {Inverse Kinematics is defined as the problem of determining a set of appropriate joint configurations for which the end effectors move to desired positions as smoothly, rapidly, and as accurately as possible. However, many of the currently available methods suffer from high computational cost and production of unrealistic poses. In this paper, a novel heuristic method, called Forward And Backward Reaching Inverse Kinematics (FABRIK), is described and compared with some of the most popular existing methods regarding reliability, computational cost and conversion criteria. FABRIK avoids the use of rotational angles or matrices, and instead finds each joint position via locating a point on a line. Thus, it converges in few iterations, has low computational cost and produces visually realistic poses. Constraints can easily be incorporated within FABRIK and multiple chains with multiple end effectors are also supported.}

  year     = {2003},
  abstract = {An efficient Inverse Kinematics solver is a key element in applications targeting the on-line or off-line postural control of complex articulated figures. In the present paper we progressively describe the strategic components of a very general and robust IK architecture. We then present an efficient recursive algorithm enforcing an arbitrary number of strict priorities to arbitrate the fulfillment of conflicting constraints. Due to its local nature, the moderate cost of the solution allows this architecture to run within an interactive environment. The algorithm is illustrated on the postural control of complex articulated figures.},

  abstract  = {In this paper, we present a technique for motion: the problem of adapting an animated motion from one character to another. Our focus is on adapting the motion of one articulated figure to another figure with identical structure but different segment lengths, although we use this as a step when considering less similar characters. Our method creates adaptations that preserve desirable qualities of the original motion. We identify specific features of the motion as constraints that must be maintained. A spacetime constraints solver computes an adapted motion that re-establishes these constraints while preserving the frequency characteristics of the original signal. We demonstrate our approach on motion capture data.}

  abstract  = {In this paper we present a novel method for creating realistic, controllable motion. Given a corpus of motion capture data, we automatically construct a directed graph called a motion graph that encapsulates connections among the database. The motion graph consists both of pieces of original motion and automatically generated transitions. Motion can be generated simply by building walks on the graph. We present a general framework for extracting particular graph walks that meet a user’s specifications. We then show how this framework can be applied to the specific problem of generating different styles of locomotion along arbitrary paths.}

The animator interactively defines a set of keyframe-like constraints which are used to derive a smooth deformation that preserves the fine structure of the original motion. Motion clips are combined by overlapping and blending of the parameter curves. We show that whole families of realistic motions can be derived from a single captured motion sequence using only a few keyframes to specify the motion warp. Our technique makes it feasible to create libraries of reusable clip motion.},

  abstract     = {We present a real-time character control mechanism using a novel neural network architecture called a Phase-Functioned Neural Network. In this network structure, the weights are computed via a cyclic function which uses the phase as an input. Along with the phase, our system takes as input user controls, the previous state of the character, the geometry of the scene, and automatically produces high quality motions that achieve the desired user control. The entire network is trained in an end-to-end fashion on a large dataset composed of locomotion such as walking, running, jumping, and climbing movements fitted into virtual environments. Our network architecture produces higher quality motion than autoregressive time-series models such as LSTMs, remains extremely fast and compact, and enables expressive, adaptive locomotion in real time across complex terrain.}

  abstract = {Forward and Backward Reaching Inverse Kinematics (FABRIK) is a recent iterative inverse kinematics solver that became very popular because of its simplicity, convergence speed and control performance, especially in models with multiple end effectors. In this paper, we extend and/or adjust FABRIK to be used in problems with leaf joints and closed-loop chains and to control a fixed inter-joint distance in a kinetic chain with unsteady data. In addition, we provide optimisation solutions when the target is unreachable and a proof of convergence when a solution is available. We also present various techniques for constraining anthropometric and robotic joint models using FABRIK and provide clarifications and solutions to many questions raised since the first publication of FABRIK. Finally, a human-like model that has been structured hierarchically and sequentially using FABRIK is presented, utilising most of the suggested joint models; it can efficiently trace targets in real time, without oscillations or discontinuities, verifying the effectiveness of FABRIK.}

  abstract  = {Solid bodies roll and tumble through space. In computer animation, so do cameras. The rotations of these objects are best described using a four coordinate system, quaternions, as is shown in this paper. Of all quaternions, those on the unit sphere are most suitable for animation, but the question of how to construct curves on spheres has not been much explored. This paper gives one answer by presenting a new kind of spline curve, created on a sphere, suitable for smoothly in-betweening sequences of arbitrary rotations. Both theory and experiment show that the resulting motion is smooth and natural, without the quirks found in earlier methods.}
